5. Trade Secrets and Confidential Information. During FA tenure, Mentor may have access to various trade secrets and confidential information belonging to FA, including, but not limited to: FA's business models, pricing and costs, as well as information pertaining to FA's clients, including, but not limited to: their identity, location, service requirements, and costs. Mentor acknowledges that such confidential information and trade secrets are, and shall continue to be, owned solely by FA. During Mentor's tenure with FA, and for two (2) years after such tenure terminates for any reason, Mentor agrees not to use, communicate, or otherwise make available such information for any purpose, or to divulge such information to any person, partnership, corporation or entity other than FA or persons expressly designated by FA, unless compelled to disclose such information by law and only after written notice has been provided to FA prior to such disclosure.

6. Documents. Under no circumstances shall Mentor remove from FA's offices or digital storage any FA books, records, documents, or client lists, or any copies of such documents, without FA's prior consent; nor shall Mentor make any copies of such books, records, documents or client lists for use outside of FA's programs, except as specifically authorized by FA.

7. Non-Solicitation/Non-Compete. Mentor agrees that, during the term of this Agreement, and for a period of twelve (12) months after this Agreement has been terminated for any reason, Mentor will not, directly or indirectly, solicit any FA director or employee for work deemed competitive with FA's programs.

8. Survival. The obligations contained in Paragraphs 4 through 7 shall survive termination of this Agreement.
